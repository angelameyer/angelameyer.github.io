Question 1:
Hi George, 
Happy to help you become more comfortable with the search engine world and Algolia as a whole.
Let’s start with Indexing and Records.
An Index refers to a data set within Algolia. Indices are created by Indexing, which is how you import, update and format the data you wish to perform search queries against.
Records are the individual objects in the Index, and show up as results when given a matching search query. 
For example, if I wanted to build a search engine around restaurant reviews, a Record would refer to a restaurant, including all of it’s attributes like reviews, popularity and open hours. An Index would be a list of multiple restaurants, and I could update the Index as I add more restaurants or more reviews are added, or format the restaurants xxxx.
Last, Custom Ranking Metrics allow you to put relevance on records that perform well on a specific business metric. Using the restaurant example, a Custom Ranking Metric could be a raw number, like the number of reviews a restaurant has, or even a number that you’ve computed on your end, like a popularity score. Using Custom Ranking Metrics, a restaurant record with a large number of reviews and a high popularity score would appear before others that meet the traditional search criteria.
I’m happy to get on the phone to discuss individual Custom Ranking Metrics for your specific use case as they are unique to every customer. Please let me know if you need any further clarification on these or any concepts in the onboarding process. 

Best Regards, 
Angela
